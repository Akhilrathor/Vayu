 Q.56) what is singleton design pattern and syntax and example?
 Q.57) how to reallocate and deallocation memory in singleton pattern? (Cross question low priority)
 Ans.
 
 The singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance during the lifetime of an application and provides a global, shared point of access to that instance. It's commonly used for shared resources like loggers, app settings, network managers etc.
 
 Pattern Components:-

 * Private initializer: Prevents other parts of the code from creating instances.

 * Static (shared) property: Holds the single allowed instance and provides global access.

 * Class (or struct – less common): The pattern is most often used with classes.
 
 
 By default, a Singleton in Swift lives for the entire lifecycle of the app, because it’s usually created as a static constant. That means it doesn’t deallocate automatically.

 If you want to control allocation and deallocation:

 Don’t use static let. Instead, use a static variable with optional type, so you can set it to nil when not needed.

 This way, ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) will deallocate the instance when you remove all references.

import UIKit

class SingletonViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Usage
       let manager = NetworkManager.shared
        manager?.fetchData()
        
        // Deallocate
        NetworkManager.shared = nil   // ARC releases memory here
    }

}

class NetworkManager {
//    static let shared = NetworkManager()  // global instance
    
    static var shared:NetworkManager? = NetworkManager() //Use a static variable with optional type, so you can set it to nil for deallocation
    private init() {}  // prevents external instantiation
    
    func fetchData() {
        print("Fetching data from server...")
    }
}
