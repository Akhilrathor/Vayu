 Q. 58) what is weak and unowned keyword in ios?
 Ans.
 
 Weak:-
 * A weak reference is a reference that does not increase the reference count of an object.

 * When the referenced object is deallocated, the weak reference is automatically set to nil.

 * Therefore, a weak property must always be declared as an optional type.

 * Use Case: When the referenced object can become nil during the lifetime of the reference, such as in delegate relationships.
 
 
 Unowned:-
 * An unowned reference is also a non-owning reference (does not increase reference count).

 * Unlike weak, an unowned reference is assumed to always have a value (non-optional).

 * If the referenced object has been deallocated and you try to access it, this causes a runtime crash.

 * Use Case: When both objects should always exist togetherâ€”the reference should never be nil as long as the referencing object is alive (example: parent and child; closure capturing self).
