 Q. 87) what is solid principle?
 Ans.
 
 SOLID is an acronym for five key object-oriented design principles introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), aimed at making software designs more understandable, flexible, scalable, and maintainable.
 
 Here is a summary of each principle:

 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
 * A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it has only one job or responsibility.

 * Benefits: Easier testing, reduced complexity, better maintainability.

 * Example: Separate Report generation and Report printing into separate classes.

 2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
 * Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

 * Benefits: Allows new features to be added without changing existing code, reducing risk of bugs.

 * Example: Extend Invoice class functionality using subclasses without modifying it.

 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
 * Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without altering the correctness of the program.

 * Ensures inheritance is used properly and subclasses behave as expected.

 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
 * Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

 * Encourage creating small, specific interfaces rather than large general ones.

 * Benefits: Reduced side effects and improved modularity.

 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
 * High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

 * Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

 * Promotes loose coupling and easier testing.
 
 Interview Q&A

 Q. What does SOLID stand for?
 Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion.

 Q. Why are SOLID principles important?
 They reduce dependencies, improve code maintainability and scalability, and prevent "software rot."

 Q. How does the Single Responsibility Principle help in design?
 By ensuring each class or module solves one problem, reducing complexity and making testing easier.

 Q. What is the essence of the Dependency Inversion Principle?
 Code should depend on abstractions (interfaces), not on concrete implementations, promoting loose coupling.
